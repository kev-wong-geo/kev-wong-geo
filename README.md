- 👋 Hi, I’m @kev-wong-geo (Dr. Kevin Wong, postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, formerly of University of Bologna and University of Leeds)
- 👀 I’m interested in igneous petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, in particular the modelling of mantle processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write python without looking like an idiot (and failing).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving mantle petrology, magma generation processes and petrology of the Ethiopian Rift, combining petrological processes with geodynamics, deep carbon cycling, hydrogen generation at subduction zones.
- 📫 How to reach me - @GeoKevW (Bluesky), kw433@cam.ac.uk
