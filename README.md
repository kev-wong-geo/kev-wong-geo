- 👋 Hi, I’m @kev-wong-geo (Kevin Wong, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, U.K.)
- 👀 I’m interested in igneous petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, in particular the modelling of mantle processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write python and VBA without looking like an idiot and failing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving magma generation processes and petrology of the Ethiopian Rift.
