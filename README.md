- 👋 Hi, I’m @kev-wong-geo (Dr. Kevin Wong, Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences (BiGeA), University of Bologna)
- 👀 I’m interested in igneous petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, in particular the modelling of mantle processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write python without looking like an idiot (and quite possibly failing).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving mantle petrology, magma generation processes and petrology of the Ethiopian Rift.
- 📫 How to reach me - @GeoKevW (Twitter), kevin.wong@unibo.it
